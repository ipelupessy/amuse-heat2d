## amuse-heat2d example

This repository contains a worked out example of interfacing and coupling a
physics code with AMUSE. Its the basis for a software carpentry lesson
and a workshop at the Netherlands eScience Center.


This README briefly documents the exercise, ie how to get from the "original"
code in ```code``` to the worked out interface in ```heat2d``` and the test 
scripts ```test_validation.py``` and an example coupling application 
```applications.py```.

### Preparations

Starting point of the exercise is the code contained in the directory 
```code```. Verify that you can compile and run this code

### Generating a stub AMUSE interface

### Integrating the source code and building a minimal low level interface

### Completing the low level interface and testing

### The high level interface

#### Data model

#### State model

#### Properties and other loose ends

#### Testing

### Validation

### Applications

### Coupling example
